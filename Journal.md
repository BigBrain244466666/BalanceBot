# June 4th: Designed and made the Schematic!

It's been a few days since I created this project, I was busy the past few days so no work was done. I was able to lock in today and finish designing the breadboard circuit, giving me an idea of what the robot will be like. I used Fritzing to make the diagram, and it's helping me visualize what the circuits, schematic, and PCB will be.

This technically should not have taken this long, but I spent a long time trying to find the perfect parts. Since this was a Bluetooth-controlled car, I didn't want to get a microcontroller with a separate Bluetooth module, nor did I want to get an extremely bulky one, so I settled with an ESP32 Wroom 32. It is small, powerful, and has Bluetooth, making it perfect for my car.

I also spent time learning how to import components into Fritzing (I'm kind of new to this), It worked out in the end, but boy was it a tough journey. I couldn't find much help online, so I had to resort to the AI to teach me...

Finally, with the breadboard circuit sorted out, I finished the breadboard. It was much easier than the first time (when I made my Macropad, learning how to use Kicad for the first time), I actually knew how the software worked and I could easily import new symbols, it felt awesome!

Overall, I think today was an extremely productive day, I even worked a bit during the Zoom meeting! Hope tomorrow will be as productive as today. :)

Edit: Tomorrow I need to change the ESP32 version to 32U. I can't find anywhere that sells the other one.

**Total time spent: 4h**
